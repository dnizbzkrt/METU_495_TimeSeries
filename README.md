This study uses a variety of forecasting models, such as ARIMA, ETS, TBATS, NNETAR, and PROPHET, to predict the monthly 10-year bond yield for the United States. The principal tool for this extensive study is R-Studio. The dataset is carefully preprocessed before forecasts are produced. To ensure data integrity, the study includes unit root checking, anomaly cleaning, and outlier analysis. The forecast models are carefully fitted using careful handling of noisy data, and their performances on the training and test datasets are carefully compared concerning several comparison criteria. The results show that NNETAR performs the best out of all the considered models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complex patterns of the US 10-year Bond Yield. With its insightful analysis of the differences in performance between various forecasting models, this paper offers practitioners and researchers a deeper understanding of financial forecasting.
